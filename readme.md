If the field of ML was Doc Brown, this introduction to machine learning tutorial is Marty McFly. 

You'll not be able to invent time travel, but you'll be able to stumble and fall all the way to saving the day.

## ML vs AI

_Admittedly this is the kinda sh*t your 'manager' will spout._ 
_If you really are one of those who want to get to work, ignore this._

- Machine Learning is a 'subset' of AI
	- deals with extant algorithms and their implemetation
- AI is all the research going on around Intelligent Machines

## Learning?

- Ability to *generalize* from specific examples
	- Incorrect to ask questions about a pottery course in a Machine Learning Course
	- Incorrect to ask the _same_ question that was taught - even if with different data
	- Expected to extrapolate or *infer* answers from the questions that were studied

## Is there a Glossary?

## Common Problems we try to solve

- *Binary Classification*: put an example into one of 2 available classes, for e.g. Object of Type A or B, Student is proficient or not, Yes or Not
- *Multi-class Classification*: put an example into one of many available classes, for e.g. each 'digit' in a set of handwritten numbers can be a class, now we need to predict which of the images belong to which class (and hence represents which number)
- *Prediction or Regression*: Try and predict a value
- *Ranking*: Rank courses, movies, web pages in order of relevance

When we break machine learning problems this way, we give ourselves a method for measuring the error
