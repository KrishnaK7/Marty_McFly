## ML vs AI

- Machine Learning is a 'subset' of AI
	- deals with extant algorithms and their implemetation
- AI is all the research going on around Intelligent Machines

## Learning?

- Ability to *generalize* from specific examples
	- Incorrect to ask questions about a pottery course in a Machine Learning Course
	- Incorrect to ask the _same_ question that was taught - even if with different data
	- Expected to extrapolate or *infer* answers from the questions that were studied

## Common Problems we try to solve

- *Binary Classification*: put an example into one of 2 available classes, for e.g. Object of Type A or B, Student is proficient or not, Yes or Not
- *Multi-class Classification*: put an example into one of many available classes, for e.g. each 'digit' in a set of handwritten numbers can be a class, now we need to predict which of the images belong to which class (and hence represents which number)
- *Prediction or Regression*: Try and predict a value
- *Ranking*: Rank courses, movies, web pages in order of relevance

When we break machine learning problems this way, we give ourselves a method for measuring the error
